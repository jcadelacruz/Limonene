GAME: Limonene
DEADLINE: anniv or bday

  3 game modes i can think of rn:

UI for first two: flat 2d world, kinda like pokemon but inspired by soul knight (no gravity, essentially top down view)

Game modes:
  1. Pieces mode (wait out the timer)

Joystick to move around, 2 weapon buttons that u can press
Weapons have a cooldown, indicated by the outline of the button (or opacity or smn idfk)
All weapons are unique, in damage, range, knockback, player knockback, spread, magic effect, weight (?), reload rate, amt of bullets, etc
You can shoot both weapons one after the other

User has
Integer amt of health and damage
speed will be treated separately, most likely double
As for regen, im not sure yet, might js copy soul knight and have two health bars, one that regens (armor), one that doesnt (hp)

Soul knight style random generation of rooms (?)
Rooms could be different sizes, but they will all be handmade, just put through a randomizer so its more fun
Rooms branch out from the center (your base) and gradually reveal themselves as waves are completed
There are 3 - 5 waves (might have boss fight at the end?)
Pieces will be dropped by the enemies or by random chests
Enemy pathfinding goes towards your base, but also if youre too close theyll go for you
Youll be alerted if theyre get too close to your base, and youre faster than them so you can usually catch up
But their strength is in numbers and u have to level up and upgrade yourself or your weapons (upgrades can be 20mtd style or js straight up buy what u can with whatever currency or level system i use)
Additional feature im not sure of adding yet: ability to build baracades or build in general
> Kind of turns the game into a more interesting tower defense

After the game ends, win or loss, you keep your pieces. You can slot them in 10 at a time or smn into the gacha machine, and you will get a random photo of us two or smn ganun 
Also replay the game and get a higher level so higher score woo
 
  2. Letter mode (inspired by slenderman board game by basco non stop)
21x33 grid daw idk
No time limit, the goal is to get all the letters before slenderman (or whoever) gets you and kills you
There would be 20 letters to get, maybe most are red herrings not sure yet, but once you have the set of real ones you win somehow
There are houses which u can enter via door
You can walk around freely
Slender can only move a set amount of tiles per turn, but always goes towards you, and hes faster than you
After some time limit (which shortens as more pages are obtained) slender moves to a random position 
If slender catches you, you die (unless theres a shield or life system or smn) but still the more you get caught the worse your experience is
Slender cant see through walls or doors, and cant enter houses (cant teleport in either) so theyre safe spaces but u gotta move eventually
Not sure if ill add sound design cuz idk how to make a game spooky
Also might add random items like flashlight that helps your sight (since its dark) or the shields or extra lives yes
Maybe if u get caught with an extra life u get teleported somewhere random and your screen gets glitchy idk

After the game is done you can read the letters i wrote to you (if you found them)
Might make some letters rarer or put in places hard to get so its more difficult and incentive to play more
Oh also keep replaying to get a higher score (less deaths and faster time)


UI for third: platformer type
  3. Puzzle platformer
where you shoot stuff so you have better mobility
Guns can boost and push you around
Or maybe they have abilities like grappling hook, magnet thingy, paintbrush from stick fight style build shit
Anw the point is to get to the checkpoint or whatever
Maybe its like a puzzle game and the locations are significant places in our rs ykyk

If you complete it maybe gravity will be removed and u can js fly through the scenes
